# That's just the beginning!
Probably, only professional teams create operating systems!
But that's not right, have you ever wondered what "friendship" means?
It is certain that only large collaborators are building operating systems there.
But be a code developer! I'm just a child who
behaves like a technician, I also make drawings as a child
And remember to help me! Thank you!
